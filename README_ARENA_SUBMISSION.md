- OpenAI API Key
- Anthropic API Key (optional, for fallback)

### Installation

#### Automated Setup
```bash
./setup.sh
```

#### Manual Setup
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Create environment file
cp backend/.env.template backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your API keys
```

### Configuration
Edit `backend/.env` with your API keys:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
python3 app.py

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## 🎉 Features Implemented

### Core Requirements
1. **UAVLogViewer Extension** - Seamlessly integrated with existing codebase
2. **Python/FastAPI Backend** - High-performance async API with MAVLink parsing
3. **MAVLink Protocol Support** - Complete .bin file parsing with telemetry extraction
4. **Agentic Chatbot** - Maintains conversation state with proactive suggestions
5. **Flight Anomaly Detection** - Dynamic LLM-based analysis and safety scoring
6. **Full-Stack Integration** - Chat interface integrated into existing Vue.js app

### Advanced Features
1. **Real-Time Flight Path Animation** - 3D drone cursor with interactive controls
2. **Comprehensive Analysis Dashboard** - Safety scoring, anomaly alerts, and metrics
3. **Professional PDF Report Generation** - Multi-page reports with executive summaries
4. **Multi-Tab Interface** - Chat and Dashboard views
5. **Cross-Flight Intelligence** - Historical analysis and trend comparison
6. **AI-Powered Recommendations** - Intelligent maintenance and safety suggestions

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async API framework
- **MAVLink Parser**: Extracts telemetry from .bin files using pymavlink
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 with Anthropic Claude fallback
- **Agent Memory System**: Persistent conversation state with cross-flight analysis
- **Anomaly Detection**: Dynamic LLM-based analysis with comprehensive safety scoring

### Frontend (Vue.js 2)
- **Tabbed Interface**: Chat and Dashboard views
- **Three.js Integration**: Real-time 3D flight path rendering with animation
- **Analysis Dashboard**: Comprehensive flight analysis with safety scoring
- **PDF Generation**: Professional report export with jsPDF + html2canvas
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing UAVLogViewer codebase

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Basic Functionality
1. Upload a .bin flight log file via the chat interface
2. Verify 3D visualization loads with colored flight path
3. Ask questions about the flight data in the chat

### Advanced Features
1. **Animation**: Use play/pause/speed controls for flight path animation
2. **Dashboard**: Switch to Dashboard tab to view safety scores and alerts
3. **PDF Export**: Generate professional reports with the "Export Report" button
4. **Interactive Analysis**: Click GPS points to view detailed telemetry data

### Expected Behavior
- Flight path renders in 3D with altitude-based coloring
- Drone cursor animates along the path with user-controlled speed
- Dashboard provides comprehensive safety analysis and recommendations
- PDF export generates professional multi-page reports
- Chat maintains conversation context and provides proactive suggestions
